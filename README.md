# IB-cGAN
Code for paper IB-cGAN

The code and model trained by pytorch will be released after acceptance.


We show some interesting videos below. The z is a latent representation vector with 8 elements.

1. We manupulate all the elements of z from -1 to 1 simultaneously.

2. We manupulate all the elements of z from -1 to 1 simultaneously for a specific patient.


2. We manupulate the 3-th element of z from -1 to 1, and set all other elements to 0.

3. We manupulate the 4-th element of z from -1 to 1, and set all other elements to 0.


4. We manupulate the 5-th elements of z from -1 to 1, , and set all other elements to 0.


5. We manupulate the 8-th elements of z from -1 to 1, , and set all other elements to 0.
